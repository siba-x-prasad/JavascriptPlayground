# Introduction to JavaScript

## what is Javascript ?
- It is a dynamic, weekly typed programming language which is compiled at runtime
- It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any Machine(Host Environment)
- **One more Definition**
- It was created to make webpage more dynamic( eg. change content on a page directly from inside the broswer). Originally, it was called LiveScript but due to the popularity of java, it was renamed to JavaScript.
- There is nothing common in java and javascript.

## How Javascript executed ?
- JavaScript is an interpreted language.
- This means we do not have to compile the JavaScript source code before sending it to the browser.
- An interpreter can take the raw JavaScript code and run it for you.
- The lack of type system is what makes JavaScript slow to run.
- Every browser provides a JavaScript engine that runs the JavaScript code. 
- The Netscape browser used the SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine.
- This engine was a rudimentary interpreter with no optimizations. Running the JavaScript code with this engine was slow but it worked.
- SOURCE CODE  => BASELINE COMPILER => BYTE CODE => INTERPRETER => BINARY => CPU
- A rudimentary JavaScript engine contains a baseline compiler whose job is to compile JavaScript source code into an intermediate representation (IR) which is also called the bytecode and feeds this bytecode to the interpreter.
- The interpreter takes this bytecode and converts to the machine code which is eventually run on the machineâ€™s hardware (CPU).
- This is just like how Java works but the bytecode generation is done by the programmer and bytecode is shared universally rather than the source code.
- SpiderMoney JavaScript has evolved into a piece of complex machinery to produce highly optimized machine code and currently used in the Firefox browser.

## Javascript at runtime
- Javascript is single-threaded language at runtime.
- That means the code execution will be done one piece at a time. 
- Since code execution is done sequentially, any code that takes a long time to execute will block anything that needs to be executed after that. 
- Hence, sometimes you see (Page  Unresponsive) on the screen while using Google Chrome.
- Like any other programming language, JavaScript runtime has one stack and one heap storage. 
- A heap is a free memory storage unit where you can store memory in random order. 
- Data that is going to persist in for a considerable amount of time go inside the heap. 
- Heap is managed by the JavaScript runtime and cleaned up by the garbage collector.

- **STACK**
- A stack is a region in memory, which operates in First-In-Last-Out mode. 
- One can imagine it as a pile of paper sheets. 
- When you put a piece of paper on a table and put another piece of paper on top, you first have to take the upper piece of paper up in order to take the first one up (you are only allowed to take one piece of paper at a time). 
- When a new thread is started by a computer program (usually the main thread first ;) ), a new stack is created. 
- It is small and can be used to quickly store and retrieve temporary data. In C, The stack is usually used for low-cost data, like simple data types (integer, float, pointer (which is also just an integer),...) to keep it speedy and prevent a stack-overflow.

- **Heap**
- The heap, which is also called "free store", is a large region in memory, which can be used to store arbitrary data in an unordered fashion. 
- That's why it's a lot slower, and used for data structures in classic languages, like C. A lot of science went into optimizing the way space is allocated in heap, so that there is a minimum number of gaps in between data. 
- In order to quickly find heap-data when doing operations, a pointer to it is stored on the stack.

## How  to execute JS code using Node js and see the  bytecode
- These  are the   steps  How JS file  executes
- myJsFile.js =>  Parser => AST(Abstract Syntax  Tree) => Interpreter (Convert JS to Virtual Byte code)  => Optimizer => Compiler => Machine Specific Code
- To Execute the javascript  in local machine
- node myJsFile.js
- To Print the byte code
- node --print-bytecode myJsFile.js
- To print the only function byte code
- node --print-bytecode --print-bytecode-filter = functionName MyJsFile.js

##  Clear understanding of JS code execution in Browser
- Everything happens inside an Execution Context
- It is of two types
  - Memory Component  (Variable Environment) - Where all variable, function are  stored  with key   value pair
  - Code Component (Thread of Execution)  -  It is just  like thread in which all code run one after another.
  - Javascript  is a Synchronous Single threaded scripting language
- Let us  understand  the  below example
```
MyJsfile.js

var  number = 2;
function square(num){
    var squareValue = num*num;
    return squareValue;
}
var variable1 = square(2);
var variable1 = square(number);
```
- In the above js  code, all the variable and function  will  be initialized inside Memory Component like  this
```
key  : number
value : undefined

key : square
value : Full functiton Body

key  : variable1
value : undefined

key  : variable2
value : undefined
```
- Initially all variable will be  assigned to  undefined.
- When it  will execute, now the execution  comes to Code component.
- In  code component, it will execute one by  one line from Memory component. 
- The variable will  be assigned to actual value passed in  the js  file
- Now  in come to square function
- square  function  will create another Execution  Context and same process will be applicable that is mentioned above.

## Setting up proper Environment

- Use Visual Studio Code
- Install helpful Visual Studio Code plugins
